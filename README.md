---


## Roadmap

For the future, in no particular order and subject to change:

- Migrate all styles to **styled-components**, as minor flexbox issues are still prevelant, despite various refinements and are becoming difficult to identify.
- Create custom components for forms and buttons, and potentially sunset ant design due to its redundancy within the app (excluding forms)
- Address the issue with APIs not displaying charts for the chart section, if not possible then abandon charts altogether :(
- Redesign the user interface, to facilitate the addition of user login functionality.
- Add a user login functionality, where users are able to create accounts and select favourite artists and save searches, and from there can receive tailored song suggestions.
